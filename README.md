`Finally up can be down!`



## First off...
#### What is this?
This project is an attempt at recreating the relative gravity mechanic from [Super mario Galaxy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFAT6BqhE5A). It enables you to easily make gravity go in all directions.

#### How do I use Relativity?
Relativity includes two new components:
- The **Custom Gravity Forcefield**:
    > A component that allows you to create areas in which gravity behaves in a unique way.

- The **Custom Gravity Effector**
    > An addition to the Rigidbody component, objects that have a Custom Gravity Effector are affected by the Custom Gravity Forcefields.

## Demo
If you wish to see an example of Relativity in practice you can play the similarly named game [Relativity](https://stupidplusplus.itch.io/relativity) or [Watch a playthrough here](https://youtu.be/oe3HTqd1Dw8).

## Credit
This project was inspired by Mario Galaxy and coded from scratch by me.

Alright well have fun playing with this. Peace out‚úåüèª!
